        Return & Exchange Policy

    <p class="Text">
        For purchases made at a Fresh store, when returned within 60 days of our shops re-opening, an exchange,
         store credit or a refund will be issued when accompanied by a receipt. Refunds will only be issued back 
         into original form of payment.
        For purchases made on fresh.com, when physically returned within 60 days of our shops re-opening, an
         exchange or a store credit (store credit to be used at a physical Fresh shop only), will be issued
          when accompanied by a receipt. The shipping
         confirmation email issued with purchases made on fresh.com is considered the original receipt.
        For purchases in the UK, this return policy does not affect your statutory rights.

<div class="container Text-Body-Block" >
    <p class="Text">
        When your fresh.com order arrives, please inspect the package for any damage.
         It is normal for the shipping package to show some wear, however, if you think 
         a product in your shipment is damaged, please contact us immediately at returns@fresh.com 
         or 1-800-373-7420. Please provide the order number along with your email address and phone
          number for fastest service. To ensure prompt resolution, please keep the original shipping 
          package and the damaged product for inspection. If, after having examined the product, we
           confirm that it is damaged, we will provide you instructions for returning the damaged product
            to us at our expense and issue a refund for the price you paid for the product to the original
             purchaserâ€™s method of payment. Your original shipping and handling charges will not be refunded,
              but any replacement for a damaged or defective product will be shipped to you free of charge.
